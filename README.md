<Short description about yourself (5 sentences)>

Hi! I am Ashley Josh V. Vequiso, I live in Dumlog, Talisay City, Cebu. My hobbies are playing online games specifically Dota 2 and Valorant, I also love listening to music, and studying. The reason why I take BSIT as my course because I love how technologies changes in a short period of time, I also love to code and design. Be humble always!
